# WanderSafe

## Overview
WanderSafe is a platform for users to schedule SOS messages to emergency contacts. Messages can contain information such as location data or contingency plan instructions. Additionally, they can be recurring or one-time-only and can be disabled by the user at the press of a button. The advantage of having WanderSafe manage such messages rather than sending them upfront is that the user can maintain greater control of potentially sensitive information and, thus, can retain additional privacy, sharing information only if the user doesn't disable the message before it is scheduled to be sent.

## Example Use Cases
* __Solo Hiking__: A user can set a message to send an SOS to an emergency contact if they don't return from a solo hike within an estimated timeframe. The message can contain the location of the trail, the intended route, parking location, and other relevant information.
* __Cross-Country Road Trip__: A user can set a daily SOS to send if they don't check in. The SOS can contain the planned route, instructions for how to handle receipt of an SOS message, such as "Call me first, and if I don't respond, call the person I'm road tripping with. If they don't respond, call the police", and if desired, the user's last known location based on metadata from the user's last check-in.
* __Date Night__: A user can schedule a message to prompt a friend to call or text and give them an excuse to leave a date if it is not going well. Alternatively, the user can schedule a text message to themselves for the same purpose.
